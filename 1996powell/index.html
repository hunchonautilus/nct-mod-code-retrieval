<center><div style="width:50%"><p>I've decided not to host the codes for Powell '96 here right now.<br>Right before I start work on Powell 2000, I'll release some revisions for the mod touching up a couple of things; a quick pass-through to increase/ensure quality before producing the sequel.<br>Once that's done, it'll be available here. Otherwise, you can just play it <a href="https://www.newcampaigntrail.com">on the mod loader</a>.<br><br>Thanks, Powellmaniacs!</p></div></center>
