You have won the presidential election, Mr. Lincoln, and with it the bounties of fate which presage an end to this cruel war. Four long, testing, and terrible years of strife have given way to a new era: a new nation, conceived in liberty, dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal—a nation which, thanks to your efforts, will now long endure.</p><p>The surrender of the traitorous Confederates is all but assured. In a few precious months, General Grant will accept the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, and the work of rebuilding these United States will commence.

The name Abraham Lincoln will pass into the annals of history, as the hand which once cut wood in rural Indiana will now sign the document proclaiming an end to the barbaric practice of slavery, and let freedom ring throughout the lands. At your destined hour, struck down by an assassin’s bullet, you will take your place among the greatest men in history, and witness the fruits of your efforts as future generations strive to fulfill that great promise.</p><p><i>“It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from this earth.”</i><br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1i()'>Coda</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p>Schuyler Colfax will ascend to the Presidency following your untimely death. Being only forty-two years old at the time, he will become the youngest President in history. Despite your own moderate tendencies, he was always the more radical between the two of you, and his administration will reflect that. His aggressive Reconstruction will succeed in elevating the voting power of the black man, empowering the Freedmen's Bureau and putting down the Ku Klux Klan to preserve those rights throughout his two-term Presidency. With the Ironclad Oath applied, the South will remain hostile to his agenda.</p><p>Despite his flagging popularity over his two terms, Colfax will leave an indelible mark on the Republican Party, empowering its Radical wing and leaving his Vice President, Henry Wilson, to continue his legacy in 1872. The Republican Party will come to align closely with industrial interests as salience shifts towards economic issues, and their corrupting influence will see the Democrats back in power by 1884. Nevertheless, Colfax’s contributions will seal his party’s commitment to equal rights for decades to come, even as the last vestiges of Reconstruction are peeled away a short while after he leaves office.<br><br><button onclick='backe1i()'>Back</button></p></span>"
