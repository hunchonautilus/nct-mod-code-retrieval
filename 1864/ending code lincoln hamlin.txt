The early morning was near-frigid, but it was at that time when the crack of sun rose above the tree line of the lake that one could be certain of a good catch. He cast his line in, and felt a tug. Encouraged, he began to reel it in. And there it was.</p><p>“What a catch!” exclaimed Hamlin aloud. There it was, a beautiful twenty inch smallmouth bass. The fish flopped helplessly against the floor of his boat. Smiling, he set aside his fishing rod, picked the fish up, and threw it in his bucket.<br><br><button onclick='nexte0()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending1' style='display: none;'><p>“The President shall certainly like to have this!”</p><p>He was intent on getting that fish cast and set upon a mount, that he may mail it to President Lincoln. He hadn’t taken his loss in the election too well, but that was none the matter. Hamlin had promised the President a trout, and here was a prize trout like no other.</p><p>Giddy with excitement, he picked the fish again to have a look at it. Look at those gills! Those eyes! Here was a creature of no intelligence whatsoever. It simply swam along, thinking not, ignorant to any troubles of life. <i>Oh, to be a fish!</i> Hamlin thought to himself.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p>Before he could finish that thought, a massive golden eagle swooped down and snatched the fish from his hands. The trout was gone in a flash, much to the Vice President’s dismay.</p><p>Hamlin looked at his empty hands, then up at the bird flying away with its catch. Dusk began to bathe the lake—feeding time was over.</p><p>“Oh dear,” said Hamlin as he admitted defeat and began to row back to shore.<br><br><button onclick='backe1()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte2()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending3' style='display: none;'><p>On the second morning, with his line, lure and tacklebox, the Vice President made his way down the steps of the hillside and down to the dock.

There was no finer carved a chair in all of Maine, of that he was certain.</p><p>Sitting down, Hamlin lit a tobacco pipe to start the day. He could see the bubbles on top of the water, indeed, it was fishing time. He opened the box containing his bait: a collection of earthworms in moist dirt.

The night shone bright in this part of Maine, and the warm summer air made for a perfect night. The light of his cabin met the light of the flame, and shadows danced against the wall. In the woods around him, he heard the cry of the owlet cut through the trees.</p><p>On the quiet coast, a loon called forlornly. Hamlin gazed into the fire, then down at his plate. He had earlier caught a salmon, and now he had salted and cooked it for consumption. He thanked God for such a peaceful night, and dug in.</p><p>How lovely tasted the bounty of nature!

It was just right.<br><br><button onclick='nexte0()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending1' style='display: none;'><p>The election was over, and sure, his ticket had lost. But Hamlin didn’t mind. To him, this was a long-overdue vacation, and he was glad to be done with all that politicking anyway. His true calling was the one true passion he had always held since the days before he entered the Senate: the art of fishing.</p><p>With his fisherman’s hat fit snugly on his head, the old man made for a cozy site to any visitor. He stoked the fire some more, finished his scrumptious meal, and reached for his tin where he kept his digestive biscuits. Looking up at the stars, he thought of what lay beyond him, and was awed by the stunning beauty of space.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p>Away from all the noise, this is where he was in his element.

And livin’ in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of room downstairs where the powder used to be in. Havin’ all that room, seein’ as how they took out all the powder barrels, they decided that they didn’t have to take out their garbage for a long time.<br><br><button onclick='backe1()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte2()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending3' style='display: none;'><p>We got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it’d be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump.

He said:</p><p>Kid, we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a half a ton of garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it.</p><p>And I said, yes, sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie.<br><br><button onclick='backe6()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte6()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending7' style='display: none;'><p>I put that envelope under that garbage.<br><br><button onclick='backe7()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte7()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending8' style='display: none;'><p>After speaking to Obie for about forty-five minutes at the door we finally arrived at the truth of the matter, and he said that we had to go down and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to him at the police officer’s station.

Despite your spirited efforts to retain your post, your political instincts failed you, and not even the dogged persistence of your best generals could save the National Union from a total drubbing in this election. You have outraged those to your flank in the Radical wing, and it is certain that they will seize power within the party after your failure here. Jefferson Davis is rubbing his hands with glee, this result doubtlessly proving a relief at a time where his own prospects seemed to dwindle. Millions of black hands are surely outstretched in lamentation, their fates now sealed.</p><p>McClellan will take office in March, by which time you have previously vowed to have this War over and done with. That seems unlikely, as despite the capture of Atlanta, the Union Army appears unable to make further headway in the Western Theater. You have lost the faith of Americans the country over, who have lost so much only to gain so little.<br><br><button onclick='nexte0()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending1' style='display: none;'><p>The President-to-be is unqualified in every respect, and his dangerous incompetence will make him but a seatwarmer for the Copperheads who will be running his Administration.</p><p>The road ahead is dark. You can persist in your effort to win the War by way of unconditional surrender, but you are fast losing allies. You are increasingly likely to find naught but closed doors if you seek new ones. You could opt to begin negotiations now, as you are certain this is what will result anyway once McClellan takes the oath. You may have cause for hope, as such a resounding victory for him might redouble his own vow to win the War despite his party’s disagreement. If you are going to reach out, you had better get started now, before Daniel Voorhees and Fernando Wood get into that braggart’s skull and win his ear.</p><p>We are truly sorry to see this outcome for you, sir. Truly sorry.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button></p></span>"
