In spite of opposition from party bosses, Roosevelt has taken a torch to the power of the business magnates choking the American worker, busting trusts and settling labor disputes in a manner that has increased his popularity. With the death of his only viable competitor, Mark Hanna, Roosevelt is the natural choice of the party for continued prosperity in the next four years.<br><br><button onclick='next0()'>More</button></p></span><span id='screen1' style='display: none;'><p>The reorganizer Democrats, reeling from two consecutive losses with the populist standard bearer William Jennings Bryan, have elected to choose Judge Alton Brooks Parker, who has resigned from the New York Court of Appeals to run on a more conservative platform. While Bourbons and Tammany men alike can breathe a sigh of relief, the party is still bitterly divided on the subject of currency; it is hoped that Parker’s prior neutrality on many issues may provide a blank slate upon which to build. Still, it is to be wondered whether any man can hope to overcome the force of nature that is Roosevelt and the ascendant Republicans, who enjoy all the benefits of incumbency and a united party.<br><br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span>\", \"image_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/htNlFcb.png\", \"winning_electoral_vote_number\": 239, \"advisor_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/W2TTJCS.png\", \"recommended_reading\": \"<h4 style=\\\"margin-top: 0.5em;\\\">General Resources</h4>  <a href=\\\"http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&amp;year=1904\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Final 1904 Results</a> <br> <a href=\\\"https://elections.harpweek.com/1904/Overview-1904-1.asp\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">1904 Overview, by HarpWeek</a> <br> <h4>Accounts of the Campaign</h4>  <a href=\\\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">TimesMachine, from New York Times</a> <br> (consulted from July to October 1904)\", \"has_visits\": 0, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"https://i.imgur.com/VgvzPDm.png\"}}]");

He was first appointed to the New York Supreme Court in 1885, eventually rising to be Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, the most powerful judicial office in the state.</p><p style='margin-bottom: 0em;'>If one were to be cynical, it would be apparent that the only reason for both Bryan and Cleveland’s declining the nomination is that whoever runs for the Democracy is destined to defeat. Judge Parker’s strength lies in his obscurity: he has hitherto declined to offer positions on much of anything. It was on this basis that he was able to unify the Convention; his judicial record of integrity and support for the common man may provide enough of a cushion to propel him to victory without getting bogged down in the political divides of the day.</p></div>\", \"color_hex\": \"#FFA30E\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#FFCC73\", \"is_active\": 1, \"image_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/ayhyK3q.png\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \"<h3>Congratulations!
